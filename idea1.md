# 1: Cloud Native (22,50 ects)

## What is the problem we are trying to solve?

One of the main reasons companies hesitate to migrate to the cloud is the fear of vendor lock-in. Ending up being dependent on a specific cloud provider, and making it close to impossible ever to switch providers because it would be too expensive.

Each cloud provider tries to lure the customers into using cool special products to lock them into their ecosystem - and it is very tempting because these cool services provider nice benefits - but the problem is that they end up locking themselves in.

This is what CNCF tries to prevent. Their purpose is to maintain open-source technologies that work on all cloud providers.

Instead, you want a fully cloud agnostic setup that you can move from one vendor to another with minimal effort. If your current cloud provider increases the price of their service, you should be able to transfer your systems to another provider.

I claim that most companies do a lot of research on which cloud provider to pick and then expect to stay there for the many years to come because they expect it to be very costly to change afterward.

## What is the contribution to the world?
> So the question is, how can you build a modern software stack in cloud-native technologies to avoid vendor lock-in?
Design, Implement and Evaluate infrastructure required by a modern tech stack in cloud-native technologies that can be deployed to ANY popular cloud provider.

I want vendor-agnostic things like databases, microservices, deployment systems, and production/staging environments to be easily moved between vendors in order to avoid vendor lock-in.

I want to prove that you can build your modern infrastructure (with everything included) only using open source cloud-native technologies, which you can move between cloud providers without any issues.
