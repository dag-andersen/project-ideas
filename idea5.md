# Generic DevOps Metric system

Problem:

DORA have 4 key metrics (and a 5th) that meassure how good you are at devops.

Problem is, that it is hard to do the collection of these metrics on a generic (non-specific) environment.

Research question: Is it possible to construct and maintain a collection of metrics that independent of your software toolstack can measure these five metrics?

Could limit the ops part to Cloud native to make sure that you get some of that in as well (and who does not like cloud native, right?!)
