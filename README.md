# ITU Project Ideas

## Fall 2022

- A mandatory Research Project (7.5 ects) 
- An individual project (22,75 ects)

## Spring 2023

- Thesis (30 ects)

## Ideas

- [Cloud Native (22,50 ects)](move-stack-into-k8s.md)
*TL;DR:* How can you build a complete modern software stack in cloud-native technologies to avoid vendor lock-in?
- [Site Reliability Engineering (22,50 ects)](repeatable-stack.md)
*TL;DR:* How to build a reliability and repeatable cloud environment in order to ensure the highest availability and the lowest MTTR?
- [Chaos Engineering (22,50 ects)](chaos-engineering.md)
*TL;DR:* How do conveniently apply the concept of chaos engineering to a Kubernetes setup in order to ensure resiliency?
- [(de)scheduling to minimize wasted resources (22,50 ects)](descheduling.md)
*TL;DR:* How much can introducing an de/re-scheduler lower the resource-cost on an auto-managed Kubernetes cluster (without lowering the uptime)? 
- [Utilizing kubernetes as an universal control plane (22,50 ects)](control-planes.md) (_Not finalized_)
*TL;DR:* Explore the benefits of shifting to control planes
- [Hashicorp Nomad vs. Kubernetes (22,50 ects)](control-planes.md) (_Not finalized_)
- [Generic DevOps Metric system (? ects)](generic-dev-ops-metric-system.md)

## Side Goals

- Learn Go

## Interests

- Cloud-Native
- Kubernetes
- Linux
- Container orchestration
- GitOps & Infrastructure as Code
- Site Reliability Engineering
- Chaos Engineering
- Rust
- Go
- Low-level stuff like memory management, thread management, compilers, etc.

## Bachelor's Project 2020
- Supervised by [Philippe Bonnet](https://www.itu.dk/people/phbo/)
- The project was about how cache utilization impacts performance when working with memory-mapped files.
- I used it as an "excuse" to learn Rust (Which is now my favorite language)
- [Report Link](https://github.com/dag-andersen/Rust-Memory-Map/blob/master/docs/Bachelor_Report.pdf)

## ITU official goals for individual project
- To identify, define and delimit a problem within information technology.
- To identify and analyse relevant means for solving the problem, such as academic theories, methods, literature, tools and other sources, as well as existing solutions to the problem.
- To combine the selected means, develop them further if necessary, and apply them in a concerted effort towards the solution of the problem.
- To evaluate the achieved solution.
- To report in a coherent and stringent way the problem, the background research, the work towards the solution, the achieved solution, the evaluation, and other relevant material, while adhering to the academic standards.
- To reflect upon the problem, the chosen approach, the achieved solution, and other findings.
