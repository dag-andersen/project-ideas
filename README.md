# ITU Project Ideas

## Fall 2022

I will write two projects in Fall 2022. A mandatory Research Project (7.5 ects) and an individual project (22,75 ects)

## Spring 2023

I will write my thesis (30 ects)

## Ideas

- [Cloud Native (22,50 ects)](idea1.md)
*TL;DR:* How can you build a complete modern software stack in cloud-native technologies to avoid vendor lock-in?
- [Site Reliability Engineering (22,50 ects)](idea2.md)
*TL;DR:* How to build a reliability and repeatable cloud environment in order to ensure the highest availability and the lowest MTTR?
- [Chaos Engineering (22,50 ects)](idea3.md)
*TL;DR:* How do conveniently apply the concept of chaos engineering to a Kubernetes setup in order to ensure resiliency?
- [(de)scheduling to minimize wasted resources (22,50 ects)](idea4.md)
*TL;DR:* How much can introducing an de/re-scheduler lower the resource-cost on an auto-managed Kubernetes cluster (without lowering the uptime)? 

## Side Goals

- Learn Go

## Interests

- Cloud-Native
- Kubernetes
- Linux
- Container orchestration
- GitOps & Infrastructure as Code
- Site Reliability Engineering
- Chaos Engineering
- Rust
- Go
- Low-level stuff like memory management, thread management, compilers, etc.

## Bachelor's Project 2020
- Supervised by [Philippe Bonnet](https://www.itu.dk/people/phbo/)
- The project was about how cache utilization impacts performance when working with memory-mapped files.
- I used it as an "excuse" to learn Rust (Which is now my favorite language)
- [Report Link](https://github.com/dag-andersen/Rust-Memory-Map/blob/master/docs/Bachelor_Report.pdf)
