# ITU Project Ideas

## Fall 2022

I will write two projects in Fall 2022. A mandatory Research Project (7.5 ects) and an individual project (22,75 ects)

## Ideas

### 1: Cloud Native (22,50 ects)
How can you build a modern software stack in cloud-native technologies to avoid vendor lock-in?

Design, Implement and Evaluate infrastructure required by a modern tech stack in cloud-native technologies that can be deployed to ANY popular cloud provider.

Here I want vendor-agnostic things like database, microservices, deployment system, and production/staging environment to be easily moved between vendors in order to avoid vendor lock-in. 

### 2: Kubernetes Operators (7,5 ects)
Design, Implement and Evaluate a Kubernetes Operator

Here, the plan is to learn Go and implement a Chaos Monkey (running as a Kubernetes operator).

I am also considering building one in Rust and doing experiments to see which one performs the best. 

### 3: Site Reliability Engineering (22,50 ects)
From Pets to Cattle - How to build a repeatable cloud development and production environment?

Building a complete modern tech stack fully cloud agnostic/native, based on principles like infrastructure as code.

I want a single command that spins up a production, staging, and testing cloud environment with logging, monitoring, database, service, and GitOps. Everything is fully automated and version-controlled. 

_I did a mini version of this in my free time last summer, but I would like to extend it to include everything a modern development environment requires. The scope of this project can easily be scaled up and down depending on how much time I have._

### 4: Chaos Engineering (22,50 ects or Thesis)
Design, Implement and Evaluate a state-of-the-art Choas Engineering cloud setup.

The plan is to set up a Kubernetes cluster, deploy some simple dummy-services, and create an automated Chaos engineering setup.

This idea is not finalized, but I thought this could be my Thesis that was built on top of the other ideas. 

## Side Goals

- Learn Go

## Interests

- Cloud-Native
- Kubernetes
- Container orchestration
- GitOps & Infrastructure as Code
- Site Reliability Engineering
- Chaos Engineering
- Rust
- Go

## Bachelor's Project 2020
- Supervised by Philippe Bonnet
- The project was about how cache utilization impacts performance when working with memory-mapped files.
- I used it as an "excuse" to learn Rust (Which is now my favorite language)
