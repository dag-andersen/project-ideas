# Utilizing kubernetes as an universal control plane

## These topic covers:
- Cloud-Native
- Infrastructure as Code
- GitOps
    - Bootstrapping problem
- Why control planes?
- Declarative configuration vs. declarative APIs
- Terraform vs. Crossplane
- Controlling external resources from inside Kubernetes
- Scalability
- Infrastructure streamlining 

## Notes
- What is the difference between crossplane and just building your own operator? I can't tell what the gain is from using crossplane vs. just building you own controller/operator.
